"Director of Analytics" commanding higher salaries compared to standard data analyst roles.

Variation by Company: Prestigious companies like Meta and AT&T offer competitive salaries,
though the highest salary is surprisingly offered by Mantys for a "Data Analyst" role.

Salary Spread: There is a wide range in salaries even within similar roles, which may reflect
different levels of seniority, scope of responsibilities, or company-specific pay scales.
